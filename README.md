# Boosting Customer Retention with Data-Driven Insights!

## Situation:
A few weeks after presenting a customer demographics dashboard to the management team of a telecom company, the Retention Manager reached out, impressed by the insights provided. The manager's goal was to reduce customer churn by identifying those at risk before they terminate their contractsâ€”a proactive approach to customer retention in an industry where customers are hard-earned.

## Task:
My task was to create a comprehensive Power BI dashboard that could visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to customer retention. The dashboard needed to provide clear and actionable insights for the retention team to preemptively engage with customers at risk of leaving.

## Action:
To tackle this, I:

### Defined KPIs for customer retention, including reducing churn rates by increasing the sale of longer contracts (1 and 2 years) by 5% each, increasing automatic payments by 5% yearly, and lowering tech support tickets per customer for Fiber Optic users to 0.5.

### Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI that visualized customer demographics, contract types, internet services, payment methods, and customer risk analysis.

### Identified critical insights, such as the fact that 89% of customers with month-to-month contracts had a higher risk of churn, and those using Fiber Optic services had a 41.89% churn rate compared to other types.

## Result:
The dashboard provided the Retention Manager and the engagement partner with clear, data-driven visuals that highlighted high-risk segments. This proactive insight allowed the retention team to focus their efforts on targeted customer engagement strategies, shifting from a reactionary to a preventative approach. The work was well-received by management, opening doors to more data-driven decision-making across departments.

This project underscored the power of data visualization in driving business strategy. I am excited about leveraging these skills for future data-driven initiatives to help businesses achieve their retention goals!
